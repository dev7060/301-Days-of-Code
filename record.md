Day 33: Continued solving programming problems using C language <br/>
Day 34: Continued solving porgramming problems using C language. Now at one point, I literally thought there's something wrong with compiler or background stuff, which isn't the case. Should figure out the issue in my code soon.<br/>

Day 40: Completed all the Basic JS challenges of @freeCodeCamp except for the two that I haven't got yet. <br/>
Day 41: Started working on the portfolio site. <br/>
Day 42: Practiced some batch programming (menus), plus started with freeCodeCamp's ES6 challenges. <br>
Day 43: Made some programs using C language <br/>
Day 44: Started working on a CLI based password manager written in C language https://github.com/k9-devs/Ninik <br/>
Day 45: Proceeded with ES6 challenges from @freeCodeCamp . And gotta say, stuff is starting to be tricky now. <br>
Day 46: Solved some CodeChef problems using C language. <br>
Day 47: Worked on some more C language programs covering various concepts. <br>
Day 48: Continued programming in C language covering several concepts. <br>
Day 49: Worked on the Ninik password manager https://github.com/k9-devs/Ninik. Added the functionalities of saving and retrieving passwords. <br>
Day 50: Worked on the password manager app. Successsfully implemented the delete entries functionality. Plus some other improvements like automatically resizing of window, changing the windows' title etc. <br>
Day 51: Continued working on the password manager. Implemented the functionality of master password and for changing it as well. <br>
Day 52: Implemented the encrypted storage of passwords (Ninik Password Manager). Also the decryption part as well. But the algo used for now is very basic. Since the source code is open, one can design his/her own algo to encrypt passwords. More security! <br>
Day 53: More C language programming. Concepts covered: file handling, random number generation plus many more <br>
Day 54: Continued C language programming. Used the concepts of file handling and rand() function. Also tried to combine some batch scripting with C. Some things didn't work as expected, but anyway.<br>
Day 55: Solved some practice programming problems using C language. <br>
Day 56: Started working on a text editor using C langauge https://github.com/k9-devs/Text-Editor <br>
Day 57: Worked on the password manager. Now it can generate random strong passwords using small & capital alphabets, digits and special characters. <br>
Day 58: Worked on the password manager and text editor. Text editor can now open files. Password manager is stuck with a bug. <br>
Day 59: Worked on the password manager. Started implementing encryption and decryption of master password. <br>
Day 60: Completed and tested all the basic functions of the password manager. Just some final touch ups and it'll be ready for the beta release. <br>
